# Texture Synthesis - Based off [TSVQ by Wei and Levoy](https://graphics.stanford.edu/papers/texture-synthesis-sig00/texture.pdf)

The main function currently has 3 methods running if you wish to run each variation 
separately (single , multi, multi + TSVQ) simply comment out the methods and leave the desired
one uncommented. In order to change the neighborhood sizes, at the top of each of the methods
is an integer value "const int nbGrid = N". Changing N into your desired value will construct an
NxN neighborhood, everything else is setup perfectly.

Running the current implementation will run all three variations with a 9x9 neighborhood for the 
single resolution synthesis and a 2 level 5x5 neighborhood for the multi resolution case
